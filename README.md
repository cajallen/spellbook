# Tower Defense Game
A currently unnamed tower defense game, inspired by Super Auto Pets and SNKRX.

# Spellbook
The engine, built in parallel and from relative scratch, that the game runs on. I'm using this as a working name because it has a name.

## Project goals
The primary goal of this project is to make the game without getting lost in rabbit holes or bike shed planning.

## Temp Build Instructions
1. Initialize submodules
2. Fix Vulkan include header paths and paths for linker
